## Overview
This project simulates phishing attacks to test user awareness and implements detection mechanisms for email and website phishing. It is intended for educational and security awareness purposes only.

## Objectives
- Simulate phishing attacks (emails, fake websites) to test user awareness.
- Implement detection mechanisms (email filtering, fake website detection).

## Components
- **phishing_simulation/**: Tools to simulate phishing emails and fake websites.
- **detection/**: Scripts to detect phishing emails and websites.
- **data/**: Sample emails and logs.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Flask (for fake website)
- smtplib, email (for email simulation)
- scikit-learn (optional, for ML-based detection)
- Requests (for URL analysis)

## Disclaimer
This project is for educational and awareness testing purposes only. Do not use for unauthorized phishing or malicious activity.
